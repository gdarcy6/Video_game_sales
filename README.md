# Video_game_sales

This Shiny dashboard is designed to analyze global video game sales by genre, using the "videogame_sales" dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset breaks down video game sales into four regions: America, Europe, Japan, and the Rest of the World.

The dashboard provides detailed insights into the gross sales figures for the selected region, including global gross sales, both in millions, and the percentage of total sales that the selected region accounts for. An interactive pie chart visually breaks down the selected region's sales by game genre, offering a clear perspective on genre preferences within that region. Additionally, a bar chart compares each genre's regional sales against global sales, highlighting how each genre performs on a worldwide scale.

The user-friendly interface is designed for intuitive exploration, as demonstrated in the accompanying video, which showcases the dashboard's functionality and usability.
